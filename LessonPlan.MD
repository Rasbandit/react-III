## Flow

### Major goals/notes

The mini-project for the day has minimal instructions.  It's more just api documentation and some pre-built code to start from.  This will get students a lot of hands on practice for the day.

I recommend time-boxing the concepts to 20-30 minutes.  Then diving into the mini-project early.  It's way to big to finish so there is plenty to do.  Explain the concepts as you go or after you wrap up.

I do this because students seem to better understand the concepts once they've written a decent bit of the code.

### Structure, timing, order

##### HTTP

Http requests are just how the web works.
Headers, body, url, data, etc.

##### Async / Promises

What is asyncronous?

- Have a student stand in the front waving their fingers imitating a computer.  Poke the air in front of them simulating a click even and have them react.
- Ask them to walk to the back to get information from another student.
- While they are gone show how the computer is non-responsive by trying to poke the air again.

- Repeat with having a 2nd student be the one that walks to the back to get the info.  The main computer stays responsive and checks in with the other student.

Promises are one of the primary ways of handling async in javascript.

##### JSON

Use JSON examples here to show the differences :

##### REST

Use REST examples here to show good url structure:

##### axios

Open a small demo like this one to show axios:

I recommend using the one above or pre-making your own. So that you can...

Dive into the mini-project.  It has a lot of good practice and can take extra time but teaches the concepts well.
